## E3 WOD Preparation 

In this essay I will get more into depth about my experience with the WOD activities more specifically how I prep for them. You can find the prompts to this assignment [here!](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html) 
In the Smartphone products with variables WOD, I got to have more hands on experiences working with JavaScript. In this WOD, I got to use the quick search command for the first time in VS code to find certain keywords within my code. To prepare for myself for this WOD I made sure I read all the assigned readings so I would be up to date with the concepts we are using in class. Before I started anything I read the directions multiple times. Some of them I knew right away how to do, others I didn't know where to start. But I read the directions 4 times which helped me fully understand what needed to be completed in terms of this WOD assignment. It definitely helped me that I was familiar with the directions, I felt more comfortable tackling this on. For the next WOD, to feel even more prepared I am going to look over the notes I take on our assigned readings before starting the WODs. A lot of what we do in our WODs can be found in our assigned reading so looking over my notes on them can be extremely useful. Copying and pasting the code from the directions into my html was the easiest part for me. I knew exactly where to put them and I knew which tags needed to be where. What threw me off was replacing my tags with the given strings from the directions. I had to manually go through all of them and because of this I ran into error. Changing a whole bunch at once is prone to something going. This happened to me for the first time. So would I did was I read the directions again (kind of repetitive but it's helpful) and watched the screencast. I did not know you can search for key letters or tags within your code and replace them with something within seconds. I had to figure out how to pull up that search bar on VS code with a Mac doing my own research but once I figured it out and practiced a couple time with my first attempt I felt ready to try it again. 
After completing a WOD, it feels very rewarding because you are doing it over and over again till you get it right. I don't go into a WOD assignment thinking I'd be able to finish it in 1 attempt but yes that is still the goal. I have never been able to complete a WOD in 1 attempt but I think that's a good thing. I am definitely learning from my mistakes as I go through each one and I am excited to do more in the future.
