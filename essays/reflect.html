  <h2 id="provide-a-brief-introduction-to-the-assignment-along-with-a-link-to-this-page-for-further-details">Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details</h2>

<p>Assignment 2 was a continuation of building assignment 1. We added to our assignment 1 website by adding a login, registration, and edit page. Users need to have an existing account or create a new account in order to get to the invoice page. An important part of assignment 2 is making sure that the data the user has entered in the products display page has been carried through to the invoice page and that the data did not get lost when the user was logging, registering, or editing their information. Another big part of assignment 2 is registration and log in validations in terms of passwords, emails, and names following a certain set of rules. For more information regarding further details click <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2_retrospective.html">here</a></p>

<h2 id="what-did-you-learn-from-this-assignment">What did you learn from this assignment?</h2>

<p>With assignment 2 I was able to quickly force myself to understand certain topics and concepts I had trouble understanding with the labs. Assignment 2 taught me how to use File IO and how to pass data from page to page by storing it in a temporary variable. My individual requirement specifically stressed the importance of when to use arrays and objects. I thought I had a good understanding of them but IR5 really open my eyes of when to use when.</p>

<h2 id="did-you-work-with-a-partner-assign-an-estimated-percentage-on-the-amount-each-team-member-contributed-to-the-assignment-including-yourself">Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).</h2>

<p>I did not work with a partner.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-you-get-help-when-you-needed-it-what-did-you-need-help-with">How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?</h2>

<p>With assignment 2 I sat down with a classmate to brainstorm different ideas to go about it and advice about approaching different requirements. Receiving help from classmates was helpful. I especially needed help with my individual requirement which Port gave me advice on in class to approach the requirement differently than the way I was planning on approaching it. I also needed help with moving the data from log in to invoice page. I also received help from stack overflow and W3 schools.</p>

<h2 id="how-was-developing-this-assignment-different-than-assignment-1">How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?</h2>

<p>Assignment 2 forced made me think more than assignment 1. Assignment 1 was way easier for me because it was more html work whereas Assignment 2  was more actual coding.</p>

<h2 id="estimate-the--of-time-you-spent-a-thinking-about-how-to-do-something-b-writing-code-but-do-not-include-testing-c-testing-and-debugging">Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</h2>

<p>I would say 60% of my time was use for testing and debugging, 20% went to writing code, and the other 20% went to thinking about how to do something.</p>

<h2 id="describe-what-worked-well-with-this-project-what-did-not-work-well">Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well</h2>

<p>I would say my time management allowed me to finish Assignment 2 way earlier than I finished Assignment 1. Something that did not work well was understanding my individual requirement. I had trouble visualizing how this could work with my code. This took me more time and thought than I realized but in the end I got the help I needed.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-could-go-back-in-time-and-do-things-differently-what-would-you-do-differently">If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?</h2>

<p>If I could go back and do things differently I would take more time off of work to focus on my assignment work. I work a lot of hours and coming home after a long day my brain felt fried and I spent longer figuring things out because of how tired I was.</p>
