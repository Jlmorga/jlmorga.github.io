  <h1 class="display-4">Why MIS</h1>
  <span class="date">22 Aug 2022</span>
  <hr>
  <p>I have always been back and forth on what my major should be. I was never one of those people and still am not one of those people that exactly know what they want to do after they graduate. Going in to college I always thought I would end up with a marketing degree. However as I did more research and got to experience different internships I decided in the end to pursue an MIS degree.</p>

<p>After my second internship, I realized just how big technology truly is in the workplace. Someone who understands both the business and technology sides of a company is valuable asset to the team. I want to be that person who can understand the relationship between the two and how technology can further advance business practices.</p>

<p>After taking ICS 101, it reassured me that MIS was the right path for me since I did enjoy the HTML projects we did in class. Though I found myself struggling in many aspects, in the end finishing the project was rewarding and overall fun.</p>

<p>Ever since high school, I always thought I would end up studying marketing. I decided to not follow this path because with my multiple marketing internships I realized my job would have been a lot easier if I knew how to automate a lot of the work I was doing. I have learned a lot about marketing with my 3 marketing internships so I feel like studying marketing would be repetitive.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I am extremely happy I decided to make the switch from Marketing to an MIS degree. I am excited for what this class has to offer and all the projects we will be getting to work on. As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, I believe it is in my best interest to study MIS. I am hoping with my problem solving skills and analytical thinking I can thrive in a MIS career.</p>

<p>Going into my Freshman year at the University of Hawaii at Manoa I did not even know what MIS was or why it was in the business school. As I went to more career exploration events and did my own research I learned the importance of MIS within the business realm. There were some MIS majors I knew who discouraged me from following through with my plan to switch majors at first. All of them had said their MIS classes were the hardest classes they have ever took in their life. Well I am up for the challenge.</p>

<p>If I were to give any advice to my freshman self I would say push yourself outside your comfort zone. I am capable, I am hardworking, and I can do whatever I set my mind and heart on.</p>
